### Steps to Run the App
- Download the Recipes folder
- Double click on Recipes.xcodeproj to open project
- Add signing identity under Recipes > Targets > Recipes > Signing & Capabilities
- Select an iOS / iPadOS simulator and click Build

### Focus Areas
- Adaptive UI
- Error handling for malformed and missing JSON data
- Focus was for providing best user experience given the time constraints

### Time Spent
- ~5 hours

### Trade-offs and Decisions
- The instructions indicated to use "just one screen displaying the list of recipes". Ideally, I would have presented the links and other focused information in another presented detail view

### Weakest Part of the Project
- Tests

### External Code and Dependencies
- None
